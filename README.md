Spreading Ideas Across Language Chasm

## Problem Statement

- Generally, the podcasts are available only in a single language, like the books used to be ideas worth spreading are, often, constrained by the language.
- Podcast by a non-native speaker is often skipped over, non-discriminatory, by both the native speakers and other non-native speakers

## Possible Solution

- Podcast app, for the listeners, that supports podcast translation to their preferred language
- A podcast studio for the content creators where they can review the translated content

## Challenges

- Costs associated with running the application is too restrictive
  - Possible Solution: TinyML running on user’s mobile for online inference
- Now that people are not commuting to work, the podcasts are competing for the user’s attention against Netflix, eSports, etc.
- The moat is missing, the idea can be picked and built easily by any of the existing podcast apps
  - Possible solution: could build an SDK and integrate with the existing podcast apps
- The legality around translation and distribution

## Future Directions

- Personalized accent, speed, speech synthesis
  - Premium voiceovers (ref: Morgan Freeman over Google Maps)
  - The automated speech can be too monotonous
  - Noise reduction and quality improvement for podcast creators
- Podcasts can be taken in the next stage of evolution, like the books have; Books now have translated content, the book summaries, the critical reviews etc.
  - Goodreads for Podcast
  - Premium, members-only, forums
    - A listener could ask their own questions to the creators
    - A creator would be able to check the most highlighted and discussed content
  - A listener can highlight (bookmark) and save their content
- Categorize the podcast’s content by 
  - Q&A - user can check out the list of questions discussed and jump over to any specific question
    - Questions or sections of the podcasts as “Stories” (Instagram, Snapchat)
  - Build a knowledge graph of ideas - personal and global
  - Build a personal knowledge base over the subscribed-only content
    - Integration with mind-maps
    - Integration with Anki Flash-Cards

## Extend the platform to video makers, who want to modulate speech

- Further, help video makers develop their own “deepfakes” for transmitting content in multiple languages
- Blogs to podcasts (sort of like audible for blogs)
  - Tweet threads to podcasts
- Offer SDK to apps such as meditation apps, or yoga apps, where the user can personalize the voice (pitch, tone, accent, speed)
- Real-time translation and speech synthesis, integration with Zoom and other communication apps
